# Paper Summaries Repository

Welcome to the **Paper Summaries** repository! 📚✨ This repository serves as a collection of summarized research papers that I read daily, documented in the **Issues** section. The goal is to keep track of key insights, discussions, and takeaways from each paper while making it easier to reference later.

## How It Works

- Each paper summary is logged as a **GitHub Issue**.
- The issue title follows the format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] Paper Title`
- Summaries include:
  - 📌 **Paper Title & Link**
  - 📝 **Key Takeaways**
  - 🔑 **Main Contributions**
  - 🤔 **Interesting Insights / Questions**
  - 🔗 **Related Works (if any)**

## Why Use GitHub Issues?

- ✅ Easy organization & tracking
- 🗂 Searchable archive of past readings
- 💬 Enables discussion & annotations
- 📌 Cross-referencing with related topics

## How to Navigate

- Check the **Issues** tab for the latest summaries.
- Use labels to filter by topic (e.g., `CV`, `NLP`, `ML Theory`).
- Browse closed issues for archived papers.

## Contributions & Discussions

- Feel free to **comment on issues** with insights or questions.
- If you’d like to suggest a paper, open a **New Issue** with the `suggestion` label.
